visual editors seem to be programs which allow you to affect the structure of a page without directly writing code.

semantic markup is used to better define the contents of the page for screen readers and browsers, but can sometimes affect the appearance.

`<strong></strong>` = this bit is important emphasis it for the screen reader and put it in bold on screen.

`<em></em>` = ads emphasis to words to subtly change the meaning of a sentence for the screen reader and add italics on screen.

`<blockquote cite='link'></blockquote>` = shows the contained element to be a quote. Browsers will usually indent the `<p>` contained but general indentation should be done through css.

`<q></q>` = used to put a shorter quote inside a `<p>` tag. both elements can use the cite attribute.

`<abbr></abbr>` = provides unabbreviated term when mouse hovers over abbreviation

`<cite></cite>` = used to indicate origin of citation (group or association title not persons name).

`<dfn></dfn>` = notes the first time a term is used and defined on a site (known as the defining sentence).

If Statements
"The keyword if evaluates a condition. If the condition evaluates to True then any code in the subsequent code block is executed." <- See page 160 for the quote from the book and the example.

You can use the if statement in many ways through your code. It can give the user notifications based on a certain score if it's a game.

(Links to an external site.)Else Statements
This is what happens when the if statement evaluates to False. When that happens the subsequent code in the else code block is executed.

From the example with a certain score the same can be said if the score wasn't reached. "Sorry, maybe next time!"

The seven rules of a great Git commit message
Keep in mind: This has all been said before.

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
