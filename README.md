## Welcome to my Reading Notes for Code Fellows

My name is Taylor White. I started in the tech industry in 2008 when I joined the army as a Network Engineer and have recently started coding and found that my dream of becoming a game developer is not nearly as hard as I thought. My goals are to become a game developer, either with a known studio or to start my own, and to eventually open a charity to teach underpriviledged children computer and coding skills to provide them with a competitive advantage in a world that is becoming more reliant on tech.

## My Definition of Growth

Having a growth mindset is realizing that although you are going to fail ***ALOT***, you must perservere and continue to challenege yourself in order to grow and achieve your goals. I was lucky enough to have this drilled into my head during my time in the military and it has been an invaluable skill to have.

## 3 Daily reminders to maintain a growth mindset

1. There is nothing that I cannot accomplish so long as I put my mind and effort into it. Nothing will be handed out to me and I have to stay committed to my goals in order to achieve them.
2. Look to your peers for inspiration or help, especially ones that are more successful than you currently are. You must be able to take criticism and help from others in order to hone your skills.
3. Failure is part of the process and is necessary in order to grow. Failing to try is trying to fail.

In the words of the great Albert Einstein:

  >"Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new."
