## Welcome to my Reading Notes for Code Fellows

My name is Taylor White. I started in the tech industry in 2008 when I joined the army as a Network Engineer and have recently started coding and found that my dream of becoming a game developer is not nearly as hard as I thought. My goals are to become a game developer, either with a known studio or to start my own, and to eventually open a charity to teach underpriviledged children computer and coding skills to provide them with a competitive advantage in a world that is becoming more reliant on tech.
