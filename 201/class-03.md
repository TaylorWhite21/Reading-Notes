### Decisions and Loop (Chapter 4, pp. 162-182)
- if else statements check the condition. If it resolves true, the first code block is executed. If the condition resolves false, the second code block is executed instead.
- Switch statements: Starts with a variable called the switch value. Each case indicates a possible value for this variable, and which code should run if the variable matches that value. (p. 164)
- Loops: if it returns true, the code runs. If it returns true again, the code runs again...until it returns false.
- Loop counter: Runs for a certain number of times.
- 3 Types of loops:
  - FOR: For a specific number of times.
  - WHILE: It will run while the condition is met.
  - DO WHILE: Will run the statement at least once, even if the  condition evaluates to false.
