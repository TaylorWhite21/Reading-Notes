# Markdown notes

>Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform. Markdown files are ended with eith .md or .markdown.
GitHub.com uses its own version of the Markdown syntax that provides an additional set of useful features, many of which make it easier to work with content on GitHub.com.

- single back ticks can be used to block formatting, and triple back ticks on the top and bottom for blocks of text.
- using the `@` symbol you can mention specific people of companies.
- Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.
- basic git commands: git status, git add, git command.
- If you want to embed images, this is how you do it:
`![Image of Yaktocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)`
- Any URL (like http://www.github.com/) will be automatically converted into a clickable link.
- You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens `- (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |:`
- Any word wrapped with two tildes `(like ~~this~~)` will appear crossed out. ~~example~~
- you can use `#` to make headings you can use one `#` all the way up to six `######` one being the largest and six being the smallest
- `* *` can be use to *italicize* text
