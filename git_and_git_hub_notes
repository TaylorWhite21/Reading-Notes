# Git vs Github notes

### Setting up a Git Repository
Importing
To import an existing project or directory into Git, follow these steps using the Terminal or Command Line:

1. Switch to the target project’s directory
Example:

 `cd test (cd = change directory)`

2. Use the git init command
 `git init`
Note: At this stage, you have created a new subdirectory named .git that has the repository files. Tracking has not commenced.

3. To start tracking these repository files, perform an initial commit by typing the following:

 `git add *.c`

 `git add LICENSE`

 `git commit -m “any message here”`
Now, your files are tracked and there’s an initial commit.

- Git assists with snapshots, local Operations, Tracking Changes, Loss of Data, and States
- three states (commited, modified and staged)
- `git status` to determine the state of files
- `git add filename` for one file
- `git add *` for all files
- `git commit -m “made change x,y,z”` to commit a file
- `git commit -a` to commit all changes
- `git push origin master` to push all changes to master
- `git stash` temporarily removes changes and hides them, giving you a clean working directory. 
- for cloned repositories, Git will automatically give the name “origin” to the server from which you cloned and the name “master” to your local branch.
- `git remote` lets you view the short names, such as “origin,” of all specified remote handles.
- `git remote -v` view all the remote URLs next to their corresponding short names.
