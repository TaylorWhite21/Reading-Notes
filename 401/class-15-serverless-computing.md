# What is serverless?

Serverless is a cloud computing model that provides severals services:

1. Automatically provisions the computing resources required to run application code on demand, or in response to a specific event

2. Automatically scales those resources up or down in response to increased or decreased demand

3. Automatically scales resources to zero when the application stops running. 

## Pros and Cons of Serverless computing

### Pros:
Allows developers to focus on writing code, instead of managing infrastructure giving them more time to optimize front-end functionality and business logic.

Customer pay for execution only. They are charged when a request is made and stops when it finishes.

Allows developers to code in any language or framework becaue it is polyglot.

Faster and more cost effective than other forms of computing when prallel processing is required.

### Cons:
It is not more cost effective for stable or predictable workloads.

They must cold start, this is not noticable to users but is unnacceptable to industries such as Financial Trading.

It is challenging to debug or monitor.
