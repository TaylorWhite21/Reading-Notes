## Advice

### Communicate!

1. Restate the Question
    - Restate the question for them and seek affirmation. 

2. Ask About Edge Cases
    - It’s still not time to dive right into coding the solution. Think for a bit about the inputs and expected output and think about potential edge cases to the problem.

3. Ask About Test Cases
    - This is free and you should take advantage of it. Simply ask if there are any test cases that the function should pass.

4. Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense
    - Again, you don’t actually want to start writing code in an actual language. You’ll find yourself constrained by trying to remember the methods or other idiosyncrasies of the language rather than trying to come up with the correct logic. Instead, let your interviewer know you’re going to start by writing pseudocode and fill in the actual code later.

5. Write the Actual Code and Ask if it Looks Good
    - You should now convert your pseudocode into actual code. You don’t even need to remove the comments. At this point, you just need to plug the appropriate code for your language in.
