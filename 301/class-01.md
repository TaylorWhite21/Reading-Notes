# Introduction to React and Components

## Component Based Architecture


1. What is a component?
    - A component is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.  
    - A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.  

2. What are the charactistics of a component?
    - Reusability − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.

    - Replaceable − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.

    - Not context specific − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.

    - Extensible − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.

    - Encapsulated − A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.

    - Independent − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

## What is Props and How to Use it in React


1. What is props short for?
    - Props is short for ***properties***
2. How are props used in React?
    - Props are used to pass data from one component to another.
3. What is the flow of props?
    - Prop data flow is a uni-directional flow or one way.
