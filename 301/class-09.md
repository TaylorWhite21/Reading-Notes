## [Functional Programming Concepts](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa)

1. What is functional programming?
    - A programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data
2. What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
    - It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
    - It does not cause any observable side effects  
3. What are the benefits of a pure function?
    - The code is easier to test
4. What is immutability?
    - Immutable data means that it's state cannot be changed after it is created.
5. What is Referential transparency?
    - a function that consistently yields the same result for the same input.
