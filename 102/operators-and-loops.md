## Loops
```
&& - (Logical And) Tests more than one condition 
((2 < 5) && (3 >=2)) - This expression is true because both expressions are true.

|| - (Logical Or) Tests at least one condition
((2 < 5) || (2 < 1)) - This expression is true because at least one expression is true

! - (Logical Not) - Takes a single boolean and inverts it
!true returns false
!false returns true

For loop counter:
for (var t = 0; i < 21; t++) {
	document.write(i);
