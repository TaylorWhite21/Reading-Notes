# Javascript can make a page feel for interactive

JavaScript Can run when:
• A button is pressed 
• A link is clicked (or tapped) on 
• A cursor hovers over an element 
• Information is added to a form 
• An interval of time has passed 
• A web page has finished loading 

## Steps to creating a script:

1. Define the goal of the script
2. Design the script
3. Code each step one by one

To approach writing a script, break down your goal into 
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed 
to complete that task (a flowchart can help).
