There are many different text editors that can be used by developers and most will swear that theirs is superior but it ultimately boils down to your personal choice of what works for you. What works for one developer might not be the great for another. As long as you feel comfortable with whatever program you choose and you can complete your work, then that is all that matters. Below, I will be listing the different types of features you should look for in a text editor as they will help you in being able to read, write, and understand your code.

## Desirable text editor features

When choosing a text editor, you should find one that you like but that also offers features to assist you in your coding such as:

* Color Themes
  - This feature allows you to change the color of the program. Dark is preferred because it reduces eye strain, but you can always choose whichever you feel is right.
* Code Completion
  - Text editors with this feature will display suggestions of code based on what you are typing and can save you time and headaches instead of leaving you to type your own code and possibly running into errors.
* Extensions
  - Extensions are like extra features or plugins you can install to your text editor to make it even better. Make sure to choose a text editor that has an extensive list of extensions.
* Syntax Highlighting
  - In my opinion, Syntax Highlighting is one of the most important features to have when it comes to choosing a text editor. This feature will change the text you type into different colors depending on what the code is doing. Methods are diferent colors than attributes. Elements will be a different color than variables. This makes the code much eadier to look at while working on the code and for debugging.
 
 ## A few examples of text editors
 
### [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (VS Code) 
  - VS code is a free text editor created by Microsoft and is my personal favorite when it comes to text editing. It has plenty of features, a great community, lots of tutorials, and is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux.

### [NotePad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org)
  - This text editor has been around for a long time and is quite popular among developers. It has its own online community, chat room, and wiki page as resources for assistance. It is however only available for Windows computers.

### [Atom](https://atom.io)
  - Atom is created by the great folks at GitHub and is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux machines. This text editor comes with all the important features and is definitely worth checking out for yourself.
  
  ### Remember to try out different text editors to find one that suits you best and of course to have fun. Wishing you the best in your coding adventures.
